# LiDAR-Based Autonomous vehicle using Deep Reinforcement learning by training in CARLA Simulator

  Hi, everyone. 

  This project is to implement an Deep Q-network algorythm to the brake and steering along the way task of an autonomous vehicle.
We simulated this algorythm in CARLA Simulator version 0.9.8 which is a high resolution and realistic simulator for the autonomous task.

  Thank you.
