# LiDAR-Based Autonomous vehicle using Deep Reinforcement learning by training in CARLA Simulator

  Hi, everyone. 

  This project is to implement an Deep Q-network algorythm to the brake and steering along the way task of an autonomous vehicle.
We simulated this algorythm in CARLA Simulator version 0.9.8 which is a high resolution, realistic and easy to install simulator for the autonomous task using Python.

We recommend that you open the above files with jupyter notebook in Anaconda. Copy and place the files into the folder "example" of CARLA Simulator in your Anaconda environment. Install the python library as the files mentioned.

  Thank you.
