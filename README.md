# LiDAR-Based Autonomous vehicle using Deep Reinforcement learning by training in CARLA Simulator

Hi, everyone. 

This project is about implementing Deep Q-network algorythm to brake and steering task of an autonomous vehicle.
We simulated this algorythm in CARLA Simulator version 0.9.8.

Thank you.
